# 🖥️ Coptic Social Network - Interface Preview Guide

## 🎯 Multiple Ways to View Your Interface

Since you're having Node.js compatibility issues, here are several ways to preview your Coptic Social Network interface within Cursor:

---

## **Option 1: Static HTML Preview (Instant - No Setup)**

I've created static HTML previews that you can open directly in Cursor:

### **📁 Preview Files Created:**
- `preview/interface-preview.html` - Community Groups page
- `preview/dashboard-preview.html` - Main dashboard

### **🚀 How to View:**
1. **In Cursor**: Right-click on `preview/interface-preview.html` → "Open with Live Preview" or "Open in Browser"
2. **In Browser**: Double-click the HTML files to open them directly
3. **Live Server**: If you have Live Server extension, right-click → "Open with Live Server"

### **✨ What You'll See:**
- **Community Groups Interface**: Search, filters, group cards, join buttons
- **Dashboard**: Welcome screen, quick actions, activity feed, parish info
- **Interactive Elements**: Working tabs, buttons, hover effects
- **Coptic Design**: Orthodox colors (gold, blue, red), appropriate icons
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, mobile

## **Option 2: Docker Development Environment (Full Stack)**

For the complete experience with backend API:

### **🐳 Start Development Environment:**
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/dev-preview.sh
```

### **📋 What This Does:**
- Builds Docker containers with correct Node.js version
- Starts PostgreSQL database
- Runs Django backend on port 8000
- Runs Next.js frontend on port 3000
- Creates admin user: `admin@copticsocial.org` / `admin123`
- Loads sample data (groups, users, posts)

### **🌐 Access Points:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin/

### **⚡ Commands:**
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Restart everything
./scripts/dev-preview.sh
```

## **Option 3: Cursor's Built-in Browser**

### **🔍 Using Cursor's Browser:**
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Simple Browser"
3. Enter URL: `file:///path/to/preview/interface-preview.html`
4. Or use the preview files directly

## **Option 4: Quick Node.js Fix (If You Want)**

If you'd like to upgrade Node.js for the full development experience:

### **🔧 Node.js Upgrade Options:**

**Using Homebrew (macOS):**
```bash
brew install node@18
brew link node@18 --force
```

**Using Node Version Manager (nvm):**
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

**Then run the frontend:**
